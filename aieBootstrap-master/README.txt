    *How-To-Use*
    ------------
     On runtime, a scene with multiple objects should be on display with a few windows surrounding
     the edges.

     To move around with the flyby camera, use the 'W' and 'S' Keys to move forward and backwards, 
     to move left and right, use the 'A' and 'D' keys, respectively. Using the 'X' will move you
     up and using 'Z' will move you down. When wanting to change the camera to a different one 
     simply use the camera settings tab in the scene settings.

     To change scene lighting use the settings located in the scene settings window under the
     light settings tab. Beside this panel is also an inspector for all the point lights in scene.
     Their positions and colours can be changed within each lights tab. This will update in scene
     immediately.

     To change the positions of objects in scene use the inspector for objects on the left of the
     screen. Each tab for each object contains transform settings that you can change. This will
     update in scene immediately. 

     To enable post-processing, open the post-processing tab in the scene settings to enable them
     and select between distort or blur to overlay.

     *WARNING* Terminating the console will lose process made in the session and removing the .tga,
               .obj and/or .mtl files from the release folder will break the program.
